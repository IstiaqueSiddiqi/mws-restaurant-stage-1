#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview

**Restaurant Reviews** project is created as a part of the Udacity **"Mobile Web Specialist"** Nanodegree. The project is divided into three stages.

### Stage One: Accessible and Responsive Web Apps

In this stage build a responsive web app that works on any device or screen size. Build web app to be mobile-first that meets the highest development by achieving accessibility standards. Added a service worker for creating a seamless offline experience for users.

### Stage Two: Offline Capable Web Apps

In this stage connect the web app to an external server. Making app more resilient to limited internet connectivity or bandwidth, and create a total user experience by using asynchronous JavaScript to request JSON data from the server and store data received from the server in an offline database using IndexedDB, which will create an app shell architecture.

### Stage Three: Performant Web Apps

Finally, in this stage added functionality to allow users to create their own reviews. If the app is offline, save the users' data and submit users' data to the remote database until the user is connected.
